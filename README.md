# Nechuya
A music player made using Electron/JavaScript.

This was made primarily so I could learn how to use JavaScript.

### Current features:
- A fully functioning seeker
- Basic media controls (pausing/skipping/volume adjustment)
- Song shuffling
- Looping songs
- A song selection UI with the duration, title, and artist of the song

If you'd like to see the cover art a bit better, you can click it on the bottom right and it'll be expanded some.

### How to use it
On launch, it will open to a default folder (~/Music). You can click "open folder" on the top and open up a different music folder if you'd like.

### What's with the name?
It's a butchered, romanized version of "can't hear" in Bulgarian.
