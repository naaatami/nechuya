# Nechuya
A music player made using Electron/JavaScript.

This was made primarily so I could learn how to use JavaScript - it's not super well structured, as it's more of a learning exercise.

A picture of the UI can be seen below:

### Current features:
- A fully functioning seeker
- Basic media controls (pausing/skipping/volume adjustment)
- Song shuffling
- Looping songs
- A song selection UI with the duration, title, and artist of the song

If you'd like to see the cover art a bit better, you can click it on the bottom right and it'll be expanded some.

### How to use it
Download and open a command prompt in the project directory. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

On launch, you'll just need to click "Open folder" at the top to select your music folder. 

### What's with the name?
It's a butchered, romanized version of "can't hear" in Bulgarian.
