SIGNIFCANT FEATURES
- the ability to sort upon clicking title/artist - will probably require ripping everything apart because it's done super weird right now
- searching for songs
- find a way to set a default open folder the right way. if nothing is there, display a message on start up
- playlists... will likely be easier to add if the first bullet point is addressed

UI FEATURES/TOUCH UPS
- make the buttons into fixed size symbols
- find a way to maybe nicely condense the bottom playbar when in half screen mode
- bottom bar covers elements at bottom - fix it
- make the volume slider work just a bit better

BUG FIXES
- if you open another folder while one is loading, both will load at once
- if you hold the thumb at the end of the progress bar, it just skips like crazy... maybe fix that
- slider jumps to the middle when changing songs
- going backwards does not work right in shuffle mode - takes you to another totally random song. something is probably wrong with shuffling
