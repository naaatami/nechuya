SIGNIFCANT FEATURES
- playlists... ugh. this is a much later problem, I suspect
- the ability to sort upon clicking title/artist
- loop button
- make a volume slider that opens on click
- search for a song
- enable copying
- find a way to set a default open folder the right way. if nothing is there, display a message on start up

UI FEATURES/TOUCH UPS
- add the song duration to the side of the title
- change px into a better unit at some point
- make the buttons into fixed size symbols
- find a way to maybe nicely condense the bottom playbar when in half screen mode
- fix the 40 thousand shades of gray

BUG FIXES
- if you open another folder while one is loading, both will load at once
- if you hold the thumb at the end of the progress bar, it just skips like crazy... maybe fix that xdd
- there is a bug where the slider jumps to the middle when changing songs
